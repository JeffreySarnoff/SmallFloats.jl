# ===== juliacompat.jl — the Base register (design §10.2)
#
# Base-function veneers for every draft operation that has a Base counterpart.
# Every method here is exactly one same-format spec-register call under the
# session default projection; there is no third semantics.
#
# The mapping is a declarative table partitioned over the op lists in
# ops_scalar.jl (_UNARY_OPS / _BINARY_OPS / _TERNARY_OPS): each op is either
# mapped below or listed in _NO_BASE_COUNTERPART with the reason class. The
# suite asserts that partition is exhaustive, so adding an op to a list forces
# a decision here — the same non-divergence mechanism as the registry.
#
# Scope decisions:
#   · Same-format operands only. Promotion between distinct Binary formats is
#     deliberately absent (design §2.4) — mixing formats is an explicit
#     `Convert`, not a silent widening. Binary ⋄ Float64/32/16/Integer promotes
#     to Float64 through the rules in formats.jl, as before.
#   · The extremum veneers map Base's IEEE semantics: `min`/`max` propagate NaN,
#     which is exactly draft Minimum/Maximum. The NaN-ignoring (Number),
#     magnitude, and finite families have no Base spelling — call them by their
#     draft names.
