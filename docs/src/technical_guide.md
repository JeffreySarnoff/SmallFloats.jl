# Technical Guide

How SmallFloats.jl works inside: the encoding, the projection engine, the oracle and its
correctness protocol, the performance layers, and the verification doctrine that holds
it all together. Read the [User Guide](@ref) first; this page assumes its vocabulary.

## Encoding and decoding

A value is its code point (`UInt8`). The bit layout is the draft's: sign (signed
formats), biased exponent, trailing significand; one NaN at the negative-zero slot;
no −0; ±Inf adjacent to the extremes in extended formats.

`decode` is a **`@generated` constant-tuple lookup**: per format, a `2^K`-tuple of
`Float64` datums built once from the computational decode (so table and computation
are correct by construction and asserted equivalent exhaustively). Constant inputs
still fold — `maxfinite_datum(T)` is a compile-time constant — while runtime decode
is a single indexed load (≈ 0.7 ns). The computational decode assembles the Float64
**by bits** (normalize with `leading_zeros`, place exponent and mantissa fields,
`reinterpret`), valid because every datum's exponent sits deep inside Float64's
normal range; `Float64` is thereby the *exact* carrier for all datums, an invariant
the suite checks against an independent big-float transliteration of the draft.

Ordering runs on **integer order keys**: a sign-magnitude fold into `UInt16`,
monotone with the total order, NaN mapped to `typemax`. Same-format `TotalOrder`,
`isless`, and the numeric comparisons are key comparisons (~1 ns); since a format has
at most `2^K + 1` distinct keys, vectors sort with an **O(n) counting sort**
installed via `Base.Sort.defalg` (forward and reverse orderings; anything exotic
falls back to the stock algorithm).

## The projection engine

`project(fr, ρ, X; R, sticky)` is the single write path into a code point:

```
RoundToPrecision  →  Saturate  →  Encode
```

**RoundToPrecision** produces a `Rounded(kind, sign, S, Q)` — an exact scaled
significand `S` and exponent `Q` per the draft's `Q = max(⌊log₂|X|⌋, 1−B) − P + 1`.
Two implementations, proven equivalent exhaustively:

- the **generic core** (`_rtp_core`) works on any carrier (`Float64`, `Float128`,
  `BigFloat`) via exact power-of-two scaling and a fraction ν compared against the
  mode's decision points;
- the **mask-based Float64 core** (`_rtp_f64`) extracts sign/exponent/significand
  fields directly, represents ν as a 128-bit fixed-point integer with an OR-mask
  sticky for bits shifted out, and evaluates every mode — including the stochastic
  `⌊ν·2^N⌋` comparisons and `RNITE` ties — as integer field tests. Specials, zeros,
  and (Convert-only-reachable) subnormal Float64 inputs bail to the generic core.

**Symbolic sticky** is how enclosures talk to the engine: `sticky ∈ {−1, 0, +1}`
declares the true value to be the carried value plus an infinitesimal of that sign.
The engine folds it into every comparison; the delicate case — true value just
*below* a representable dyadic — decrements into the previous binade and sets
ν = 1⁻ (encoded in the mask core as an all-ones fixed-point fraction, which
reproduces every predicate including the RNITE tie behavior). This is what lets
directed modes land exactly on asymptotes: `tanh → 1⁻` under `TowardNegative`
projects to `NextLessThan(1)`, automatically.

**Saturate** classifies against the format's range with two integer comparisons per
side, then maps the classification through the draft's twenty saturation rows to
`as-is / MaxFinite / MinFinite / ±Inf / NaN`. The comparisons stay cheap because:

- the extremal magnitude in canonical `(S, Q)` form is a constant-folded function
  of the type parameters;
- the rounded value and the extremum share one lexicographic `(Q, S)` order
  (subnormals and the lowest normal binade share the same `Q`);
- signed formats use sign–magnitude symmetry, and unsigned underflow is just the
  sign bit;
- an internal `HUGEQ` sentinel represents "finite but astronomically large" (the
  ν = 1⁻ image of an infinite endpoint), so directed `SatNone` clamps it to
  MaxFinite correctly.

**Encode** is pure integer bit assembly, including the significand-carry
renormalization and the subnormal/normal field split.

## The oracle and the result-kind protocol

Every operation's defined result is computed by `ωeval`, which returns one of five
result kinds; `apply_op` fast-splits the common one and finishes the rest:

| kind | meaning | finished by |
|---|---|---|
| `Float64` | exact (specials; representable arithmetic) | direct `project` |
| `Float128` | exact by **width analysis** | direct `project` (Float128 carrier) |
| `StickyF` | wide-spread `FMA`/`FAA` tail: head value (`Float64` or `Float128`) + tail sign | direct `project` with `sticky` set — no allocation |
| `BigExactF` | exact at 2200-bit precision (wide-spread tail for `Add`; the near-impossible `FAA` distillation miss) | `project` on `BigFloat` |
| `Enclose128F` | correctly-rounded Float128 **bracket** | sticky agreement, MPFR fallback |
| `EncloseF` | MPFR directed enclosure `f(prec)`, optional Float128 pre-filter `fq`, optional eager Float64 estimate `yd` | three-stage: `yd` → `fq` → interval protocol |

Two **rigor classes** govern every non-`Float64` path, and their arguments are never
mixed:

**Class R (unconditional)** rests on two facts that hold without any accuracy
assumption:

- **Width analysis.** Sums of decoded datums are *exactly representable* in
  `Float128` whenever operand bits + exponent spread fit 113 bits — checked in
  advance by integer exponent arithmetic (`Add` at ΔE ≤ 100, `FMA` ≤ 92, `FAA`
  span ≤ 98). Beyond the threshold, `Add` escalates to the 2200-bit path, while
  `FMA`/`FAA` take a non-allocating **sticky-head** shortcut: past that spread the
  smaller term is provably too small (by construction of the threshold) to affect
  anything but the tail direction of the larger one, so the result is
  `StickyF(head, sign)` — no `BigFloat` involved. `FAA`'s three-term case runs a
  bounded Float128 2sum-distillation (Priest-style, ≤ 6 sweeps) to find that
  head/tail split directly; the residual `BigExactF` MPFR fallback exists only for
  the near-impossible case the distillation doesn't converge.
- **IEEE correct rounding.** Division and `sqrt` are correctly rounded at *every*
  binary width, by mandate. `Divide`/`Recip` therefore use the **Float64**
  quotient directly: it is within half an ulp of truth, so it serves as
  `EncloseF`'s eager `yd` estimate with no Float128 arithmetic on the path at all.
  `Sqrt`/`RSqrt` use the **Float128** CR result: an inexact nearest-CR value `q`
  brackets the truth in the *open* interval `(prevfloat(q), nextfloat(q))`.
  Exactness itself is detected by an `fma` residual test.

**Class E (envelope-conditional).** Faithful-but-not-CR evaluations stand in for an
enclosure only inside a generous envelope, resolved by the two-sided sticky gate.
Two stages, cheapest first:

- *Float64 stage:* for operations whose Float64 libm is faithful (≤ 1 ulp ≈ 2⁻⁵²
  relative — the exp/log families, the hyperbolics, forward trig inside the
  |x| ≤ 10¹⁵ reduction window, `atan`, `asinh`, the softplus composition), the
  eager estimate `yd` carries envelope `E = |yd|·2⁻⁴⁵`, ≥ 2⁷ slacker than any
  faithful-libm error (measured margin on this machine: ≥ 2⁶·⁶).
- *Float128 stage:* libquadmath's estimate `y = fq()` carries `E = |y|·2⁻⁹⁰`, at
  least 2¹⁸ slacker than any published libquadmath bound.

In both stages, if the sticky-projected endpoints agree, that code point is the
answer; if not, the next stage (ultimately the MPFR ladder) decides. An envelope
failure can therefore only cost speed, never correctness — unless both endpoints
agree *and* the envelope is wrong, which the differential-build tests rule out
empirically by building every standard table twice (Float128-first and pure-MPFR)
and byte-diffing, and which the exhaustive oracle cross-check re-verifies per
operation against the 3072-bit protocol.

**The interval protocol** (`project_interval`) is the termination backbone: evaluate
the MPFR enclosure at precision `p`; if `lo == hi` the value is exactly
representable — project it; otherwise project `lo` with `sticky = +1` and `hi` with
`sticky = −1`; agreement (projection is monotone at fixed `R`) yields the answer;
disagreement doubles `p`, clamped to the `maxprec` ceiling (default 4096 bits,
honored exactly even when it is not a power-of-two multiple of the 256-bit start).
Termination requires that the enclosure not be chasing a value the grid can
actually hit — which is why the π-scaled operations carry **Niven peels**: for
dyadic arguments, `tan(πr)` takes rational values only at the quarter-integers
(±1) and `atan2/π` only on the diagonals (±¼, ±¾); those cases are answered
exactly before any enclosure is built, and Niven's theorem proves the peel set
complete.

## Tables and kernels

For pure specs, unary and binary operations are **finite functions** — 256 or 65 536
entries — so the kernel layer materializes them once per `(op, formats, ρ)` into a
locked cache (`Dict{TableKey, Memory{UInt8}}`, double-checked locking, builds outside
the lock) and serves every later array call as a gather: Shape-A, one load per
element, measured 0.27 ns/elem unary and 0.5 ns/elem binary. Tables are built
*through the scalar path*, so they inherit its bit-exactness; the suite asserts
table ≡ scalar over every entry.

Ternary (`FMA`, `FAA`, `Clamp`) is a finite function too — 2^(K1+K2+K3) entries —
but that count spans four orders of magnitude across the 3–16 bitwidth range (512 B
at K=3, 16 MiB at K=8), so one policy doesn't fit the whole range. A separate
`TernaryKey → TernaryEntry` cache (`_ternary_table_for`, in `tables.jl`) tiers by
Σ bitwidth:

- **Eager** (≤ 18 bits, all `K ≤ 6` combinations, ≤ 256 KiB): builds and caches
  on the first array call.
- **Adaptive** (≤ 21 bits, the `K = 7` band, up to 2 MiB): accumulates a
  per-signature element count across calls and builds only once a signature has
  processed enough elements to amortize the build; a byte-bounded LRU eviction
  (`TERNARY_CACHE_BYTES`) guards against many hot signatures coexisting.
- **Compute** (`K = 8`, 16+ MiB — a table is never worth it): `vmap!` runs
  Shape-B, the fully specialized scalar pipeline per element, optionally split
  across `Threads.@threads` for long enough arrays (each ternary draw is
  independent under a fixed, non-stochastic ρ, so lanes cannot interact).

Every ternary table entry, eager or adaptive, is still built *through the scalar
path* — the tiering changes when/whether the cache exists, never what it contains.
Stochastic calls of any arity always take Shape-B, with the RNG resolved once per
array rather than per element.

## Blocks: exactness without a superaccumulator

`blockdecode` produces each lane's `scale × element` exactly (≤ 17-bit significands
in Float64). Reductions then apply **span filters**: one integer pass over lane
exponents decides whether the whole sum (or dot product, with ≤ 33-bit lane
products) is exactly representable in `Float128`; if so, a plain `Float128`
accumulation *is* the exact answer; if not, an exact big-float accumulation takes
over. Either way there is exactly one projection, at the end. `ωBlockProject`
follows the draft's special rows for the scale (NaN, 0, ±Inf) and divides each
element result by the scale through its own cheapest-first CR-bracket / enclosure
cascade (exact Float64 quotient → CR Float128 → bracket/pre-filter → MPFR
interval), mirroring the scalar quotient group's rigor arguments.

## The κ registry and conformance

κ is the maximum code-point distance (along the total order) between an
implementation's result and the defined result, over inputs with finite defined
results; any mismatch on non-finite defined results makes κ = NaN. Because inputs
are enumerable, `register_approx!` *measures* κ exhaustively at registration and
rejects understatement — a declared bound is a verified property, not a promise.
`conformance()` assembles the declaration live from the operation registry, the
table cache, and the approximation registry.

## Verification doctrine

The value sets are small enough that sampling is never necessary, so the suite
enumerates — ≈ 8.9 M assertions in all:

- formats against an independent draft transliteration (14 679);
- ordering over all 2.5 M same-format pairs plus Next-op edge tables (7.6 M);
- every unary operation on every input against a 3072-bit protocol run; divide
  and the ternaries exhaustively;
- stochastic R-sweeps with directed-asymptote pins;
- table ≡ scalar over every entry, including the ternary tiers (eager and
  adaptive) against the scalar path;
- the sticky-head `FMA`/`FAA` escalation against the MPFR reference across every
  rounding-mode family and adversarial cancellation cases;
- blocks against a from-scratch reference composition;
- Float128 carrier ≡ Float64 carrier, and Float128-first ≡ MPFR differential
  builds;
- the mask rounding core ≡ the generic core over datums and reachable
  sums/products at boundary stochastic budgets N ∈ {45, 60};
- packed round-trips, and κ/conformance behavior.

Deterministic **specialization regressions** (concrete inferred return types at the
public entry points, zero warm-path allocation) stand in for timing assertions.

## Benchmark doctrine

Recorded after two measurement post-mortems: a benchmark closure over any non-`const`
global measures Julia's dispatch machinery, not the code under test — and it distorts
*ratios*, not just absolutes, because dispatch cost varies with call shape (a dynamic
keyword call costs ~1 µs; a dynamic positional call far less; six unresolved interior
sites cost six times one).

The rules the shipped `benchmarking/benchmarking.jl` enforces structurally:

- format types enter as type parameters, never as globals;
- operands come from untimed setup;
- functions retrieved reflectively pass through argument barriers to specialize;
- a preflight aborts the run if warm scalar paths allocate — including the
  wide-spread `FMA`/`FAA` sticky-head path.

The table-build section reports both the cold build (cache evicted per sample) and
the steady-state warm cache hit, since callers amortize the former through the
latter. Vary one binding per variant; verify specialization before believing a
number.

## Deliberate limitations

No implicit cross-format arithmetic (promotion is to `Float64`, explicitly). No
in-place packed arithmetic. Threading is opt-in and narrow: only the untabled
ternary (`K = 8`) compute kernel threads, and only above a size cutoff and when
`Threads.nthreads() > 1`; every other kernel is single-threaded.
`Irrational`/`Rational` inputs to `Convert` are rejected rather than
double-rounded silently. The `Float128` machinery never changes results — disabling
it (`SmallFloats_Float128=disable`) is a tested no-op semantically.
