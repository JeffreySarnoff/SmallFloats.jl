Worked, runnable examples. Every output shown was captured from a real session; seeds
are fixed so you can reproduce them exactly.

## Basic

### One value, every rounding mode

The value 2.30078125 sits between the `Binary8p4se` grid points 2.25 and 2.5
(ulp = 0.25 in [2, 4)):

```julia
using SmallFloats

for μ in (NearestTiesToEven(), NearestTiesToAway(), TowardPositive(),
          TowardNegative(), TowardZero(), ToOdd())
    v = Convert(Binary8p4se, ProjSpec(μ, SatNone()), 2.30078125)
    println(rpad(string(typeof(μ)), 20), " → ", decode(v))
end
```

```
NearestTiesToEven    → 2.25
NearestTiesToAway    → 2.25
TowardPositive       → 2.5
TowardNegative       → 2.25
TowardZero           → 2.25
ToOdd                → 2.25
```

(`ToOdd` keeps 2.25 because its significand is already odd; try 2.05 to see it move.)

### Enumerating a whole format

Small formats are small enough to look at in full — 16 code points for `Binary4p2se`,
sorted by the total order (single NaN last):

```julia
decode.(sort(Binary4p2se.(0x00:0x0f)))      # broadcast the code-point constructor
```

```
[-Inf, -2.0, -1.5, -1.0, -0.75, -0.5, -0.25, 0.0,
  0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, Inf, NaN]
```

This is a good way to build intuition for a format before committing to it: you can
*see* the subnormal spacing, the binade structure, and the dynamic range.

### Saturation in one line each

```julia-repl
julia> w, two = Binary8p4se(200.0), Binary8p4se(2.0);   # MaxFinite is 224

julia> Multiply(Binary8p4se, RNE_SatNone, w, two)
Binary8p4se(Inf ≡ 0x7f)

julia> Multiply(Binary8p4se, RNE_SatFinite, w, two)
Binary8p4se(224.0 ≡ 0x7e)
```

### Random values under a chosen projection

`rand` and `randn` take a `projection` keyword on their scalar `::Type` forms.
One underlying Float64 draw, landed on the format's grid four different ways —
the seed fixes the draw, the projection decides the landing:

```julia-repl
julia> rand(Xoshiro(2), Float64)                # the underlying uniform draw
0.0022505868897625403

julia> rand(Xoshiro(2), Binary8p4se)            # default: floor (stays in [0,1))
Binary8p4se(0.001953125 ≡ 0x02)

julia> rand(Xoshiro(2), Binary8p4se; projection = RTP_SatNone)   # ceiling
Binary8p4se(0.0029296875 ≡ 0x03)

julia> rand(Xoshiro(2), Binary8p4se; projection = RNE_SatNone)   # nearest
Binary8p4se(0.001953125 ≡ 0x02)

julia> rand(Xoshiro(2), Binary8p4se; projection = RSA_SatNone(8))  # stochastic
Binary8p4se(0.001953125 ≡ 0x02)
```

A stochastic projection draws its random bits from the *same* rng as the
uniform draw, so seeded streams stay reproducible. Note the default is the
contract-keeper: a nearest or upward projection can return exactly `1.0`
(mass near the top rounds up), which is why floor is the default.

The same keyword on `randn` — here the draw is `-1.9757…`:

```julia-repl
julia> randn(Xoshiro(6), Binary8p4se)           # default: nearest + SatFinite
Binary8p4se(-2.0 ≡ 0xc8)

julia> randn(Xoshiro(6), Binary8p4se; projection = RTZ_SatFinite)  # toward zero
Binary8p4se(-1.875 ≡ 0xc7)
```

Where the saturation half of the default earns its keep: `Binary3p1se` has
`MaxFinite = 1.0`, so normal tail draws overflow constantly. Seed 360 draws
`z = 3.326…`:

```julia-repl
julia> randn(Xoshiro(360), Binary3p1se)         # SatFinite clamps the tail
Binary3p1se(1.0 ≡ 0x02)

julia> randn(Xoshiro(360), Binary3p1se; projection = RNE_SatNone)
Binary3p1se(Inf ≡ 0x03)                         # opt out, get the overflow
```

The array and `!` forms (`rand(T, dims)`, `randn!(A)`, …) always use the
defaults; for arrays under another projection, draw scalars:
`[rand(rng, T; projection = ρ) for _ in 1:n]`.

### Log-odds belief updating — and where tiny formats bite reasoning

Classic probabilistic reasoning: accumulate independent evidence as log-likelihood
ratios. A sensor with hit rate 0.85 and false-alarm rate 0.30 contributes
`log(0.85/0.30) ≈ 1.0415` per alarm. In `Binary8p3se` that datum is 1.0 — and the
running belief stalls exactly the way the gradient accumulator does in the Deep
Learning section:

```julia
using SmallFloats

function logodds_demo(nalarms)
    llr = Binary8p3se(log(0.85 / 0.30))      # quantized evidence weight
    acc = Binary8p3se(0.0)
    for _ in 1:nalarms
        acc = Add(Binary8p3se, RNE_SatNone, acc, llr)
    end
    post(l) = 1 / (1 + exp(-l))
    exact = nalarms * log(0.85 / 0.30)
    (decode(llr), round(exact; digits=2), decode(acc),
     round(post(exact); digits=5), round(post(decode(acc)); digits=5))
end
logodds_demo(12)
```

```
(1.0, 12.5, 8.0, 1.0, 0.99966)
# llr datum, exact log-odds, quantized log-odds, exact posterior, quantized posterior
```

The accumulator is wrong by a third (8.0 vs 12.5 — near 8 the ulp is 2.0, so
`8 + 1` rounds straight back to 8), yet the *decision* is untouched: both
posteriors are ≈ 1. Threshold decisions need order, not magnitude — which is why
coarse formats work in reasoning pipelines far past the point where their
arithmetic looks broken. When magnitude does matter, the cures are the same as
for gradients: a wider accumulator format, or stochastic rounding.

### Fuzzy inference in an unsigned format

Membership degrees live in [0, 1] and are never negative — a job for an unsigned
finite format. `Binary8p6uf` gives a [0, 15.5] range with 1/32 resolution at 1;
the classic fuzzy connectives are registry operations (`Minimum` = Gödel t-norm,
`Maximum` = s-norm, `Multiply` = product t-norm):

```julia
F = Binary8p6uf
trap(x, a, b, c, d) = clamp(min((x - a) / (b - a), 1.0, (d - x) / (d - c)), 0.0, 1.0)
warm = F(trap(26.0, 15, 20, 24, 28))         # membership of 26 °C in "warm"
hot  = F(trap(26.0, 24, 30, 100, 101))       # … and in "hot"

(decode(warm), decode(hot),
 decode(Minimum(F, RNE_SatNone, warm, hot)),      # warm AND hot
 decode(Maximum(F, RNE_SatNone, warm, hot)),      # warm OR hot
 decode(Multiply(F, RNE_SatFinite, warm, hot)))   # product t-norm
```

```
(0.5, 0.3359375, 0.3359375, 0.5, 0.16796875)
```

Because every connective is a bit-exact registry op, a fuzzy rule base evaluated
in `Binary8p6uf` is *reproducible across machines to the code point* — a property
sampled float pipelines cannot promise.

### Search heuristics: what quantized scores keep is the ordering

Game-tree and beam search consume evaluation scores only through comparisons.
Quantizing 200 heuristic scores to 8 bits collapses them onto 78 distinct code
points — yet the argmax survives, and sorting is exact (integer order keys, O(n)
counting sort, single NaN ordered last deterministically):

```julia
using Random
rng = Xoshiro(21)
scores = randn(rng, 200) .* 3
q = Binary8p4se.(scores)

(argmax(scores), argmax(decode.(q)), argmax(scores) == argmax(decode.(q)),
 decode.(sort(q; rev=true)[1:5]), length(unique(codepoint.(q))))
```

```
(140, 140, true, [8.0, 7.5, 6.5, 6.0, 6.0], 78)
```

The two 6.0s are the caveat: quantization creates *ties* the exact scores did not
have. `TotalOrder`'s deterministic tie behavior means the search expands the same
node on every run — ties change which answer you get, not whether you can
reproduce it.

## Machine Learning

### Quantizing a weight tensor and measuring the damage

```julia
using SmallFloats, Random, Statistics

rng = Xoshiro(42)
w = randn(rng, 10_000) .* 0.25          # typical trained-weight scale
q = Binary8p4se.(w)                     # project every weight
back = decode.(q)

mean((w .- back).^2), maximum(abs.(w .- back)), count(isinf, back) / length(back)
```

```
(4.41e-5, 0.0312, 0.0)                  # MSE, max |error|, overflow fraction
```

The max error is exactly half an ulp of the largest binade the data reached — the
worst case nearest rounding permits.

### Picking a format: precision vs range

For the same Gaussian tensor, `K = 8` formats trade significand bits against exponent
range. RMSE doubles per lost significand bit; MaxFinite grows explosively:

```julia
rng = Xoshiro(7); x = randn(rng, 50_000)
for F in (Binary8p5se, Binary8p4se, Binary8p3se, Binary8p2se)
    back = [decode(Convert(F, RNE_SatFinite, xi)) for xi in x]
    println(rpad(formatname(F), 12), " rmse = ", round(sqrt(mean((x .- back).^2)); sigdigits=3),
            "   maxfinite = ", decode(MaxFiniteOf(F)))
end
```

```
Binary8p5se  rmse = 0.0133   maxfinite = 15.0
Binary8p4se  rmse = 0.0266   maxfinite = 224.0
Binary8p3se  rmse = 0.0528   maxfinite = 49152.0
Binary8p2se  rmse = 0.103    maxfinite = 2.147483648e9
```

For unit-scale data, spend bits on precision; buy range only when your data needs it
(or get it from a block scale — see below).

### Stochastic rounding is unbiased where nearest is not

Nearest rounding maps 0.30078125 to 0.3125 every single time — a systematic +0.0117
bias. Stochastic rounding is right *on average*:

```julia
target = 0.30078125                       # ν = 3/16 of an ulp above 0.296875
σ = RSA_SatNone(16)                       # StochasticA{16} with SatNone
rng = Xoshiro(1)
m = mean(decode(Convert(Binary8p4se, σ, target; rng)) for _ in 1:200_000)
(decode(Binary8p4se(target)), m)
```

```
(0.3125, 0.300765)                        # RNE result vs stochastic mean ≈ target
```

This is the property that makes stochastic rounding matter for accumulating many
small contributions (gradients, activations statistics) in a low-precision format.

### MX-style block quantization — and the staging pitfall

Block formats pair a shared scale with narrow elements, tracking dynamic range that a
bare element format cannot. Here each row of `W` lives at a different scale, spanning
~2¹⁶ across the matrix:

```julia
using SmallFloats, Random, Statistics

rng = Xoshiro(3)
W = randn(rng, 64, 64) .* 2 .* (2.0 .^ (collect(0:63) ./ 4))   # per-row scales

function mx_rows(W, ::Type{FST}, ::Type{FS}, ::Type{FE}, ::Val{B}) where {FST,FS,FE,B}
    n, m = size(W)
    [begin
        # stage through a WIDE-RANGE format so nothing clamps before scaling
        seg = ntuple(k -> Convert(FST, RNE_SatFinite, W[i, (j-1)*B + k]), Val(B))
        ConvertToBlockMaxAbsFinite(FS, FE, RNE_SatNone, RNE_SatNone, seg)
    end for i in 1:n, j in 1:m ÷ B]
end

blocks = mx_rows(W, Binary8p2se, Binary8p1uf, Binary8p4se, Val(32))
recon = [let b = blocks[i, (j-1) ÷ 32 + 1]
             decode(b.s) * decode(b.x[(j-1) % 32 + 1])
         end for i in 1:64, j in 1:64]
plain = [decode(Convert(Binary8p4se, RNE_SatFinite, w)) for w in W]

relerr(A) = sqrt(mean(((W .- A) ./ max.(abs.(W), 1e-9)).^2))
relerr(plain), relerr(recon)
```

```
(0.616, 0.109)      # plain 8p4se clamps the large rows; MX tracks them
```

!!! warning "Stage wide, then block-quantize"
    `ConvertToBlockMaxAbsFinite` takes already-`Binary` elements. If you stage your
    `Float64` data through the *element* format first, `SatFinite` clamps the large
    values **before** the block scale can absorb them, and blocks buy you nothing —
    we measured exactly that (0.617 vs 0.616) with `Binary8p4se` staging. Stage
    through a wide-range format (`Binary8p2se` above); the residual 0.109 here is the
    staging format's own precision, which bounds what any downstream scheme can keep.

At `B = 32` with an 8-bit scale the storage cost is 8.25 bits/value.

### Quantized dot products with one final rounding

`BlockDotProduct` computes every lane product and the accumulation *exactly*, then
projects once:

```julia
rng = Xoshiro(9)
a64, b64 = randn(rng, 32), randn(rng, 32)
qb(v) = ConvertToBlockMaxAbsFinite(Binary8p1uf, Binary8p4se, RNE_SatNone, RNE_SatNone,
            ntuple(i -> Convert(Binary8p4se, RNE_SatFinite, v[i]), Val(32)))
dq = BlockDotProduct(Binary8p4se, RNE_SatNone, qb(a64), qb(b64))
(a64'b64, decode(dq))
```

```
(5.0634, 4.5)       # difference is input quantization only, never accumulation error
```

### Why training loops like stochastic rounding: the swamping demo

Accumulate 400 gradient steps of 0.011 into a `Binary8p3se` accumulator. Under
nearest rounding, the moment the accumulator dwarfs the increment, every add rounds
back to the accumulator — it **stalls**. Stochastic rounding keeps absorbing the
increments in expectation:

```julia
function accumulate_demo(nsteps, g)
    σ = RSA_SatNone(16)
    rng = Xoshiro(11)
    acc_rne = Binary8p3se(0.0); acc_sto = Binary8p3se(0.0)
    for _ in 1:nsteps
        acc_rne = Add(Binary8p3se, RNE_SatNone, acc_rne, Convert(Binary8p3se, RNE_SatNone, g))
        acc_sto = Add(Binary8p3se, σ, acc_sto, Convert(Binary8p3se, σ, g; rng); rng)
    end
    (nsteps * g, decode(acc_rne), decode(acc_sto))
end
accumulate_demo(400, 0.011)
```

```
(4.4, 0.125, 5.0)   # exact sum, RNE accumulator (stalled!), stochastic accumulator
```

The stochastic result is noisy (5.0 vs 4.4 on this seed) but unbiased; the RNE result
is *wrong by 35×* and no amount of steps will fix it. In practice you keep a wider
accumulator when you can — and use stochastic rounding when you can't.

### Activation functions are 256-byte lookup tables

For pure specs, a unary activation over an 8-bit format is a *finite function* —
the whole nonlinearity is one 256-byte table, built bit-exactly through the
scalar path and then gathered per element. This is precisely the activation LUT
you would burn into an accelerator:

```julia
using SmallFloats, Random
empty_tables!()
rng = Xoshiro(4)
pre = Binary8p4se.(randn(rng, 4096) .* 2.5)       # pre-activations, ±2.5σ
act = Tanh(Binary8p4se, RNE_SatNone, pre)          # table-gather kernel

(table_bytes(),
 round(count(v -> abs(decode(v)) == 1.0, act) / 4096; digits=3),
 length(unique(codepoint.(act))),
 decode(NextLessThan(one(Binary8p4se))))
```

```
(256, 0.384, 100, 0.9375)
# LUT size; fraction saturated to ±1; distinct output codes; last value below 1
```

Two things worth staring at. First, **saturation is severe at this input scale**:
38% of pre-activations land exactly on ±1 — under `RNE`, `tanh` reaches 1 as soon
as the true value rounds past the midpoint of the last gap, and the entire
saturated tail becomes indistinguishable to the next layer. (Under
`TowardNegative` the asymptote is honored instead: `tanh` of any finite positive
input projects to 0.9375, never 1 — the projection mode is part of the activation
design space.) Second, the choice of nonlinearity changes *information retention*
in code points, not just shape:

```julia
actS = Softplus(Binary8p4se, RNE_SatNone, pre)
(length(unique(codepoint.(actS))), table_bytes())
```

```
(61, 512)          # softplus keeps 61 distinct codes here; two LUTs now cached
```

Auditing an activation for a format is this cheap: enumerate all 256 inputs,
look at the output histogram, count what survives.

### Packing a quantized model

```julia
n = 1_000_000
model = [rawvalue(Binary5p2se, UInt8(rand(0:31))) for _ in 1:n]
pv = PackedVector(model)
(sizeof(model), sizeof(pv.data))
```

```
(1000000, 625000)   # 8 bits → 5 bits per value; indexing and vmap work directly on pv
```
