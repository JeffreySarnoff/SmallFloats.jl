# User Guide

Everything you need to use SmallFloats.jl, in the order you'll need it. All transcripts in
this guide are captured from real sessions against the shipped package.

## Formats and format queries

The parametric type `Binary{K,P,SGN,EXT}` defines a format: bitwidth `K ∈ 3:8`,
precision `P` (significand bits including the implicit bit), `SGN::Bool` for
signed/unsigned, `EXT::Bool` for extended (with ±Inf) versus finite. Every legal
combination — 120 formats — has its draft name exported:

```julia-repl
julia> Binary8p4se === Binary{8,4,true,true}
true

julia> formatname(Binary{6,3,true,false})
:Binary6p3sf
```

The suffix reads: `p4` precision 4, `s`/`u` signed/unsigned, `e`/`f` extended/finite.

Format introspection follows the draft's Group M, with both Julia-style and
draft-named accessors:

```julia-repl
julia> bitwidth(Binary8p4se), precision(Binary8p4se), expbias(Binary8p4se)
(8, 4, 8)

julia> MaxFiniteOf(Binary8p4se)
Binary8p4se(224.0 ≡ 0x7e)

julia> MinPositiveOf(Binary8p4se)
Binary8p4se(0.0009765625 ≡ 0x01)
```

Also available: `MinFiniteOf`, `MinNormalOf`, `MaxSubnormalOf`, `expbitwidth`,
`trailingsigbits`, `issigned`, `isextended`, and the draft-named forms
(`BitwidthOf`, `PrecisionOf`, `ExponentBiasOf`, …).

Each of these accepts a **value** as well as a type — the answer is a pure
function of the format's type parameters, so `bitwidth(x)` and
`bitwidth(typeof(x))` are the same query and both fold to a literal:

```julia-repl
julia> x = Binary8p4se(1.6);

julia> BitwidthOf(x), PrecisionOf(x), SignednessOf(x), DomainOf(x)
(8, 4, true, true)

julia> MaxFiniteOf(x)
Binary8p4se(224.0 ≡ 0x7e)
```

## Values

A value is one byte: an immutable wrapper around its code point. Four ways in, two
ways out:

```julia-repl
julia> x = Binary8p4se(1.6)              # construct from a Real: projects (rounds)
Binary8p4se(1.625 ≡ 0x45)

julia> Binary8p4se(0x45)                 # construct from a UInt8 CODE POINT (validated)
Binary8p4se(1.625 ≡ 0x45)

julia> rawvalue(Binary8p4se, 0x45)       # same, unchecked — the kernel-internal route
Binary8p4se(1.625 ≡ 0x45)

julia> Convert(Binary8p4se, RNE_SatNone, 3)   # explicit conversion, any mode
Binary8p4se(3.0 ≡ 0x4c)

julia> decode(x)                          # exact datum as Float64 (always exact)
1.625

julia> codepoint(x)                       # the raw byte (extends Base.codepoint)
0x45
```

!!! note "UInt8 means code point; every other number means value"
    `UInt8` is the *only* argument type with code-point semantics — mirroring
    `Char(0x41)`. Every other `Real` (including other `Integer`s) constructs by
    projecting the numeric value, and `Convert` is numeric for **all** integers:

    ```julia-repl
    julia> Binary8p4se(0x02), Binary8p4se(2)
    (Binary8p4se(0.001953125 ≡ 0x02), Binary8p4se(2.0 ≡ 0x48))
    ```

    Out-of-range codes throw for K < 8 (`Binary5p3sf(0x20)` is an error); the range
    check costs nothing measurable — 2.1 ns, identical to unchecked `rawvalue`.
    Round-tripping is `T(codepoint(x)) === x`.

`Convert` accepts `Binary` values (any format), `Float16/32/64`, `Float128`,
`Integer`, and `BigFloat` — types whose values it can project *exactly*.
`Float128` projects directly, preserving all 113 significand bits: a value that
sits a hair above a rounding midpoint converts correctly where staging through
`Float64` would round it onto the midpoint first and then break the tie the wrong
way. For other `Real`s, convert explicitly first (e.g. `Binary8p4se(Float64(π))`)
and own the double rounding; `Rational` inputs throw with that guidance rather
than double-round silently.

Every format has exactly one NaN and no negative zero; extended formats add ±Inf:

```julia-repl
julia> Binary8p4se(1e9)                   # overflow under the default spec → +Inf
Binary8p4se(Inf ≡ 0x7f)

julia> Binary8p4se(-0.0)                  # no −0: projects to the single zero
Binary8p4se(0.0 ≡ 0x00)

julia> isnan(Binary8p4se(NaN)), isfinite(Binary8p4se(2.0))
(true, true)
```

Standard predicates (`isnan`, `isinf`, `isfinite`, `iszero`, `signbit`, `issubnormal`),
`zero`/`one`/`eps`/`typemin`/`typemax`, and stepping via `NextGreaterThan` /
`NextLessThan` (the draft's Next operations; `nextfloat`/`prevfloat` alias them) all
work:

```julia-repl
julia> NextGreaterThan(Binary8p4se(1.0))
Binary8p4se(1.125 ≡ 0x41)

julia> Class(Binary8p4se(0.01))           # draft classification
ClassPosNormal::FPClass = 0x06
```

## Random values

The Random API works on every format, in every setup Julia programmers expect.

**What the draws mean.** `rand` draws the real uniform on [0, 1) at Float64 and
floor-projects it onto the format's grid, so each code point receives exactly
the real measure of its interval; results are always in [0, 1). `randn`
projects a standard-normal Float64 draw round-to-nearest with `SatFinite`, so
tail draws beyond `MaxFiniteOf(T)` clamp to the extremal finite datum — `randn`
never returns ±Inf or NaN, which matters for tiny-range formats (`Binary3p1se`
has `MaxFinite = 1.0`). `randn` requires a signed format; an unsigned format
throws:

```julia-repl
julia> randn(Binary6p3ue)
ERROR: ArgumentError: randn requires a signed format; Binary6p3ue cannot represent negative draws
```

**Setup 1 — quick and implicit.** No rng argument: draws come from Julia's
task-local default generator (a `Xoshiro`), and `Random.seed!` controls them
exactly as for any other type:

```julia-repl
julia> Random.seed!(1234); rand(Binary8p4se)
Binary8p4se(0.3125 ≡ 0x32)

julia> Random.seed!(1234); rand(Binary8p4se)      # same seed, same draw
Binary8p4se(0.3125 ≡ 0x32)
```

**Setup 2 — an explicit rng stream.** Pass any `AbstractRNG` first, for
reproducible streams independent of global state:

```julia-repl
julia> rand(Xoshiro(1), Binary8p4se)
Binary8p4se(0.0703125 ≡ 0x21)

julia> rand(Xoshiro(8), Binary8p4se, 4)
4-element Vector{Binary8p4se}:
   Binary8p4se(0.40625 ≡ 0x35)
 Binary8p4se(0.021484375 ≡ 0x13)
      Binary8p4se(0.75 ≡ 0x3c)
   Binary8p4se(0.28125 ≡ 0x31)
```

**Setup 3 — arrays and in-place.** `rand(T, dims...)` / `randn(T, dims...)`
build `Array{T}`; `rand!(A)` / `randn!(A)` fill an existing array (one byte per
element — cheap to preallocate and reuse):

```julia-repl
julia> A = Vector{Binary8p4se}(undef, 3); randn!(Xoshiro(2), A)
3-element Vector{Binary8p4se}:
 Binary8p4se(-0.005859375 ≡ 0x86)
        Binary8p4se(1.75 ≡ 0x46)
        Binary8p4se(-1.0 ≡ 0xc0)

julia> randn(Xoshiro(3), Binary8p4se, 2, 3) |> typeof
Matrix{Binary8p4se}
```

Feed array draws straight into the storage layers when that is the goal:
`PackedVector(rand(Binary4p2se, n))`.

**Setup 4 — choosing the projection.** The scalar `::Type` forms take a
`projection` keyword to land the draw under any `ProjSpec`:

```julia-repl
julia> rand(Xoshiro(2), Binary8p4se; projection = RTP_SatNone)    # ceiling
Binary8p4se(0.0029296875 ≡ 0x03)

julia> randn(Xoshiro(6), Binary8p4se; projection = RTZ_SatFinite) # toward zero
Binary8p4se(-1.875 ≡ 0xc7)

julia> rand(Xoshiro(4), Binary8p4se; projection = RSA_SatNone(8)) # stochastic
Binary8p4se(0.8125 ≡ 0x3d)
```

A stochastic projection draws its random bits from the *same* rng, so seeded
streams stay reproducible. The defaults are the contract-keepers (floor for
`rand`, nearest + `SatFinite` for `randn`); opting out can produce `1.0` from
`rand` or ±Inf/NaN from `randn`. The array and `!` forms always use the
defaults — for arrays under another projection, draw scalars:
`[rand(rng, T; projection = ρ) for _ in 1:n]`. Worked transcripts, including
the K = 3 tail-clamp comparison: [User Examples](@ref).

## Projection specifications

Every rounding decision in the package is governed by a `ProjSpec`, the pair of a
**rounding mode** and a **saturation mode**. Both are zero-size singleton types, so a
`ProjSpec` costs nothing and fully specializes every call it reaches.

Rounding modes: `NearestTiesToEven`, `NearestTiesToAway`, `TowardPositive`,
`TowardNegative`, `TowardZero`, `ToOdd`, and the stochastic families
`StochasticA{N}`, `StochasticB{N}`, `StochasticC{N}` with a random-bit budget
`1 ≤ N ≤ 60`. Saturation modes: `SatFinite`, `SatPropagate`, `SatNone`.

```julia-repl
julia> ρ = ProjSpec(TowardPositive(), SatFinite())
(TowardPositive, SatFinite)

julia> RTP_SatFinite === ρ                # every pairing is also predefined
true
```

### Predefined specs

Every deterministic (rounding, saturation) pairing is exported as a constant, named
`R<mode>_Sat<mode>`:

| | `SatFinite` | `SatPropagate` | `SatNone` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NearestTiesToEven` | `RNE_SatFinite` | `RNE_SatPropagate` | `RNE_SatNone` |
| `NearestTiesToAway` | `RNA_SatFinite` | `RNA_SatPropagate` | `RNA_SatNone` |
| `TowardPositive` | `RTP_SatFinite` | `RTP_SatPropagate` | `RTP_SatNone` |
| `TowardNegative` | `RTN_SatFinite` | `RTN_SatPropagate` | `RTN_SatNone` |
| `TowardZero` | `RTZ_SatFinite` | `RTZ_SatPropagate` | `RTZ_SatNone` |
| `ToOdd` | `RTO_SatFinite` | `RTO_SatPropagate` | `RTO_SatNone` |

The stochastic families are parameterized by the random-bit budget `N`, so their
predefined forms are *constructors* rather than constants: `RSA_*` for
`StochasticA`, `RSB_*` for `StochasticB`, `RSC_*` for `StochasticC`, each crossed
with the three saturation modes. Call them with the budget — or without, for the
default `N = 8` (`SmallFloats.DEFAULT_RBITS`):

```julia-repl
julia> RSA_SatNone()                      # StochasticA with the default N = 8
(StochasticA[8], SatNone)

julia> RSC_SatFinite(16) === ProjSpec(StochasticC{16}(), SatFinite())
true
```

`RNE_SatNone` is the package's *initial* default spec. `default_projspec` reads the
session default (see **Session defaults** below), so every Base-register operator,
the same-format convenience methods, and `T(x::Real)` construction follow
`DefaultProjection()` — `RNE_SatNone` until you change it.

Rounding chooses the neighbor; saturation decides what out-of-range results become.
Watch all three interact on an overflowing product in `Binary8p4se`
(`MaxFinite = 224`):

```julia-repl
julia> w, two = Binary8p4se(200.0), Binary8p4se(2.0);

julia> Multiply(Binary8p4se, RNE_SatNone, w, two)       # overflow → ±Inf
Binary8p4se(Inf ≡ 0x7f)

julia> Multiply(Binary8p4se, RNE_SatFinite, w, two)     # overflow → MaxFinite
Binary8p4se(224.0 ≡ 0x7e)

julia> Multiply(Binary8p4se, RTZ_SatNone, w, two)
Binary8p4se(224.0 ≡ 0x7e)   # SatNone + directed-toward-zero clamps finite
```

!!! note
    `SatNone` is not "no saturation handling": it is the draft's row set in which
    nearest modes overflow to ±Inf (or NaN for finite formats) while directed modes
    that point away from the overflow clamp to the extremal finite value.

### Stochastic rounding

Stochastic modes consume `N` random bits per projection. You control the source three
ways — implicitly (task-local RNG), by passing an `rng`, or by fixing the draw `R`
itself, which makes single projections exactly reproducible and is the right tool for
tests:

```julia-repl
julia> σ = RSA_SatNone();                 # ≡ ProjSpec(StochasticA{8}(), SatNone())

julia> Add(Binary8p4se, σ, Binary8p4se(2.0), Binary8p4se(0.03125); rng = Xoshiro(1))
Binary8p4se(2.0 ≡ 0x48)

julia> Add(Binary8p4se, σ, Binary8p4se(2.0), Binary8p4se(0.03125); R = 0)
Binary8p4se(2.0 ≡ 0x48)      # smallest draw: rounds down

julia> Add(Binary8p4se, σ, Binary8p4se(2.0), Binary8p4se(0.03125); R = 255)
Binary8p4se(2.25 ≡ 0x49)     # largest draw: rounds up
```

The exact fraction here is 1/8 of an ulp, so over all 256 draws exactly 32 round up —
`StochasticA` is unbiased in expectation. `R` must lie in `0:2^N-1`.

### Session defaults

Six session-wide defaults are readable as `DefaultX()` and settable as
`DefaultX!(v)`:

| default | initial value | setter accepts |
|---|---|---|
| `DefaultType` | `Binary8p2se` | any fully-parameterized `Binary` type |
| `DefaultReturnType` | `Binary8p2se` | any fully-parameterized `Binary` type |
| `DefaultAccumulatorType` | `binary32` (`Float32`) | any `AbstractFloat` type |
| `DefaultRoundingMode` | `NearestTiesToEven()` | mode instance or type |
| `DefaultSaturationMode` | `SatNone()` | mode instance or type |
| `DefaultProjection` | `RNE_SatNone` | a `ProjSpec`, or `(mode, sat)` |
| `DefaultRNG` | the `Xoshiro` type | RNG type or instance |
| `DefaultRbits` | `8` | `Int` in `1:60` |

The projection default and its components are kept coherent in both directions:
setting `DefaultRoundingMode!` or `DefaultSaturationMode!` rebuilds
`DefaultProjection` around the change, and setting `DefaultProjection!` directly
decomposes it back into both components — so
`DefaultProjection() === ProjSpec(DefaultRoundingMode(), DefaultSaturationMode())`
always holds.

```julia-repl
julia> DefaultRoundingMode!(TowardZero())
TowardZero()

julia> DefaultProjection()               # followed the component
(TowardZero, SatNone)

julia> DefaultProjection!(RNA_SatFinite)
(NearestTiesToAway, SatFinite)

julia> DefaultRoundingMode(), DefaultSaturationMode()   # followed the projection
(NearestTiesToAway(), SatFinite())
```

`DefaultProjection` is not merely advisory: `default_projspec` reads it, so the
same-format convenience methods (`a + b`, `Exp(x)`, …), the Base-register
operators, and `T(x::Real)` construction all follow it.

```julia-repl
julia> x, y = Binary8p4se(200.0), Binary8p4se(2.0);

julia> x * y                              # RNE_SatNone: overflow → +Inf
Binary8p4se(Inf ≡ 0x7f)

julia> DefaultProjection!(RTZ_SatFinite);

julia> x * y                              # now clamps to MaxFinite
Binary8p4se(224.0 ≡ 0x7e)

julia> Multiply(Binary8p4se, RNE_SatNone, x, y)   # explicit ρ is unaffected
Binary8p4se(Inf ≡ 0x7f)
```

!!! warning "Changing the default is a global semantic change"
    Every caller of the convenience forms — including code in other packages —
    sees it. Library code that needs a specific projection should name it
    explicitly rather than rely on the session default.

Following the default costs nothing while it holds its initial value: the
convenience forms consume it through the same speculation guard as the
`with_default_*` combinators, so they compile against the constant and stay
allocation-free with concretely inferred results (pinned in the test suite).
Once you change the default they cross a function barrier instead — one dynamic
dispatch per call, everything inside still specialized. The explicit forms
`Add(T, ρ, x, y)` are unaffected either way.

To *consume* a default in your own code without paying dynamic-dispatch costs,
go through the `with_default_*` combinators — `with_default_type`,
`with_default_returntype`, `with_default_accumulatortype`,
`with_default_projection` — which call `f(default, args...)`:

```julia-repl
julia> with_default_type((T, x) -> T(x), 1.5)
Binary8p2se(1.5 ≡ 0x41)
```

While a default still holds its initial value, the combinator's call is
statically compiled against that constant — no dynamic dispatch. After the
default is changed it crosses a function barrier: one dynamic dispatch at
entry, everything inside fully specialized.

Allocation contract: when `f`'s result type does not depend on the default —
`with_default_projection` with the formats fixed by the caller is the normal
shape — the call is zero-allocation with a concretely inferred result (pinned
in the test suite). When the result's type *is* the default
(`with_default_type` used as a constructor), the value is computed on the
specialized path but boxes once where it escapes — the irreducible cost of a
runtime-chosen type.

## Scalar operations: the two registers

**The spec-named register** exposes every draft operation under its draft name with an
explicit result format and spec: `Op(fr, ρ, operands...)`. Operands may be any
formats; the result format is the first argument. The catalog:

- **30 unary** — `Abs`, `Negate`, `Sqrt`, `RSqrt`, `Recip`, `Exp`, `Exp2`,
  `ExpMinusOne`, `Log`, `Log2`, `LogOnePlus`, `Softplus`, the trig/hyperbolic
  families, and the π-scaled families;
- **18 binary** — `Add`, `Subtract`, `Multiply`, `Divide`, `CopySign`, `Hypot`,
  `ArcTan2`, `ArcTan2Pi`, and the eight Minimum/Maximum variants plus the Finite
  variants;
- **3 ternary** — `FMA`, `FAA`, `Clamp`;
- **`Convert`** — the one operation that also accepts non-`Binary` operands.

**The Base register** makes each format an ordinary Julia number under its *default*
spec (`RNE_SatNone`): `+ - * /`, `fma`, `exp`, `log`, `sqrt`, `min`, `max`, `abs`,
`atan(y, x)`, `sinpi`, `inv`, comparisons, and friends — same-format operands only,
no silent cross-format promotion (mixing formats promotes to `Float64` explicitly).

```julia-repl
julia> exp(Binary8p4se(0.25))                       # Base register
Binary8p4se(1.25 ≡ 0x42)

julia> Exp(Binary8p4se, RNE_SatNone, Binary8p4se(0.25))   # identical, explicit
Binary8p4se(1.25 ≡ 0x42)
```

Semantics highlights (all per the draft): `x/0 → NaN` for every `x` including ±Inf;
`Recip(±Inf) = 0`; `0·∞ → NaN`; a NaN operand generally propagates, except the
`*Number`/`*Finite` extremum variants which prefer non-NaN (and finite) operands;
trig of ±Inf is NaN; the π-scaled family reduces exactly mod 2 first.

## Arrays, kernels, and sorting

Every operation has array methods — `Op(fr, ρ, A)`, `Op(fr, ρ, A, B)`,
`Op(fr, ρ, A, B, C)` — plus the generic `vmap` / `vmap!`:

```julia-repl
julia> A = Binary8p4se.(randn(Xoshiro(7), 4) .* 2)
4-element Vector{Binary8p4se}:
 Binary8p4se(-0.875 ≡ 0xbe)
 Binary8p4se(4.0 ≡ 0x50)
 Binary8p4se(-3.25 ≡ 0xcd)
 Binary8p4se(2.25 ≡ 0x49)

julia> Exp(Binary8p4se, RNE_SatNone, A)
4-element Vector{Binary8p4se}:
 Binary8p4se(0.40625 ≡ 0x35)
 Binary8p4se(56.0 ≡ 0x6e)
 Binary8p4se(0.0390625 ≡ 0x1a)
 Binary8p4se(9.0 ≡ 0x59)
```

For pure (non-stochastic) specs, unary and binary array calls run as **table
gathers**: the first call builds and caches a 256-byte (unary) or 64 KiB (binary)
result table for that exact `(op, formats, ρ)` specialization, and every later
element costs a single lookup — measured at 0.27 ns/element unary, 0.5 ns/element
binary.

Ternary operations (`FMA`, `FAA`, `Clamp`) ride the same gather whenever the three
operand bitwidths keep the table affordable, tiered by `K1 + K2 + K3`:

- **Eager** (up to 256 KiB; every all-`K ≤ 6` signature): built on the first
  array call, like unary/binary.
- **Adaptive** (up to 2 MiB; the `K = 7` band): built only once a signature has
  processed enough elements to earn its build, in a byte-bounded, LRU-evicted
  cache.
- **Compute** (`K = 8`; a 16 MiB table stops being a cache win): the scalar
  pipeline runs per element, optionally threaded for long arrays.

Every table entry — eager or adaptive — is built through the scalar path, so it is
bit-identical by construction. Stochastic calls always run the scalar pipeline per
element (each element draws its own random bits).

Inspect or reset the cache — unary/binary and ternary alike — with `table_bytes()`
and `empty_tables!()`. The ternary policy thresholds and the threading cutoff are
internal `Ref`s (`SmallFloats.TERNARY_EAGER_BITS` and neighbors in `tables.jl` and
`kernels.jl`) for the rare case you need to tune them.

Sorting is special-cased: values compare through integer order keys, and vectors of
`Binary` sort with an **O(n) counting sort** installed as the default algorithm —
about 8× the stock comparison sort at 64 K elements, `rev=true` included. `sort(A)`
just works; NaN sorts last (first under `rev=true`), matching Base's conventions.
`TotalOrder(x, y)` exposes the draft's total order directly (single NaN largest).

## Blocks and scaled operations

A `Block{B,FS,FE}` is a scale in format `FS` and `B` elements in format `FE`; its
represented values are `scale × element` (the MX-style scheme). Construct directly or
quantize a tuple with the draft's algorithm, which picks the scale from the maximum
finite |element| and projects each element against it:

```julia-repl
julia> b = Block(Binary8p1uf(4.0), Binary8p4se(1.5), Binary8p4se(-0.75),
                 Binary8p4se(2.0), Binary8p4se(0.5))
Block{4, Binary8p1uf, Binary8p4se}(Binary8p1uf(4.0 ≡ 0x82), (…))

julia> ConvertFromBlock(Binary8p3se, RNE_SatNone, b)   # decode scale×elem, project
(Binary8p3se(6.0 ≡ 0x4a), Binary8p3se(-3.0 ≡ 0xc6), Binary8p3se(8.0 ≡ 0x4c), Binary8p3se(2.0 ≡ 0x44))

julia> BlockReduceAdd(Binary8p4se, RNE_SatNone, b)     # exact Σ scale·xᵢ, then project
Binary8p4se(13.0 ≡ 0x5d)

julia> ConvertToBlockMaxAbsFinite(Binary8p1uf, Binary8p4se, RNE_SatNone, RNE_SatNone,
           (Binary8p4se(100.0), Binary8p4se(-12.0), Binary8p4se(0.5), Binary8p4se(3.0)))
Block{4, Binary8p1uf, Binary8p4se}(Binary8p1uf(64.0 ≡ 0x86), (…))
```

Every scalar operation lifts to blocks (`BlockAdd`, `BlockExp`, …, taking blocks and
a result scale) and to the scaled form `ScaledOp` (`ScaledAdd(fr, ρ, s1, x1, s2, x2)`
— block size 1). Reductions: `BlockReduceAdd`, `BlockReduceMultiply`, and
`BlockDotProduct(fr, ρ, bx, by)`, whose lane products and accumulation are **exact**
before the single final projection — there is no hidden intermediate rounding.
`ConvertToBlock(fs, fr, ρ, xs, s)` quantizes against a scale you supply.
`BlockVector` stores many same-shape blocks in structure-of-arrays layout.

## Packed storage

For memory-bound work, `PackedVector{F}` stores code points at `bitwidth(F)` bits
per element (a `Binary5p2se` vector at 5 bits/element instead of 8):

```julia-repl
julia> v = Binary5p2se.(rand(Xoshiro(3), 6) .* 4);

julia> pv = PackedVector(v); sizeof(pv.data)
8                     # 6 × 5 bits = 30 bits → one 64-bit word

julia> pv[3] == v[3]
true
```

It is a full `AbstractVector{F}` (indexing, `collect`, iteration), and `vmap` accepts
it directly, unpacking cache-friendly tiles internally. The rule is *store packed,
compute unpacked*: there is deliberately no in-place packed arithmetic.

## Conformance and κ-approximate implementations

`conformance()` returns the live declaration — formats, operations, mode vocabulary,
the table specializations actually instantiated this session, and every registered
approximation. `conformance_report()` prints it; `conformance_dict()` returns a
plain nested `Dict` for JSON/TOML serialization.

The default API is bit-exact, always. If you *want* a faster inexact kernel, register
it — and the registry measures your honesty:

```julia-repl
julia> ftz = ftz_variant(:Exp, Binary8p4se, Binary8p4se, RNE_SatFinite);  # Annex example

julia> impl = register_approx!(:my_fast_exp, :Exp, Binary8p4se, (Binary8p4se,),
                               RNE_SatFinite, ftz);

julia> kappa(:my_fast_exp)      # measured max code-point deviation, verified exhaustively
4.0
```

Declaring `κ` smaller than the measured deviation throws; NaN-mismatching
implementations must be acknowledged with an explicit `κ = NaN`. Retrieve with
`approx(:my_fast_exp)`, list with `list_approx()`, and measure anything yourself with
`measure_kappa` / `codedistance`.

## Performance guidance

- **Pass format types statically.** Through `const` bindings, type parameters, or
  function arguments, every entry point fully specializes (scalar `Add` ≈ 18–26 ns,
  `project` ≈ 13 ns, zero allocations). A format type read from a **non-`const`
  global** forces Julia's dynamic dispatch on every call (~1 µs for keyword calls);
  one function barrier `f(::Type{T}, …) where {T}` restores full speed.
- **The convenience forms are free at the initial default.** `x + y`, `Exp(x)`,
  and `T(2.1)` read the session default through a speculation guard, so they are
  allocation-free and concretely inferred while it holds its initial value. After
  you change the default they cost one dynamic dispatch per call; name ρ
  explicitly (`Add(T, ρ, x, y)` with a `const` ρ) in hot code that must be
  insensitive to the session default.
- **Bulk work belongs in array calls.** The table-gather kernels are ~50× the scalar
  path; the first call per specialization pays a one-time build (≈ 0.4 ms unary,
  tens of ms for 8×8 binary tables, up to a few ms for a 2 MiB ternary table).
- **Ternary array calls scale with bitwidth.** `K ≤ 6` operand formats table
  eagerly (~35× the scalar loop); `K = 7` tables adaptively once a signature is
  hot; `K = 8` runs the compute kernel, optionally threaded for long arrays
  (~4× at 4 threads) — no action needed, the array call picks the right path.
- **Stochastic array calls** run the scalar pipeline per element; pass an
  explicit `rng` for reproducibility.
- **Memory:** `PackedVector` for storage; `BlockVector` for many blocks.
- The reproducible benchmark suite lives at `benchmarking/benchmarking.jl` and generates
  a full markdown report for your machine.

## Environment switches

`ENV["SmallFloats_Float128"] = "disable"` (set before `using SmallFloats`) disables the internal
`Float128` fast paths in favor of pure MPFR — results are bit-identical (tested);
only build/oracle speed changes.
